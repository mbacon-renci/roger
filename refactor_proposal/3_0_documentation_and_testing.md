## Documentation and testing

This section perhaps needs no introduction, as all code can generally
benefit from greater documentation and testing. In this case, the
documentation will come from lessons learned from the deployment at
RTI. Testing in particular will focus on functionally proofing the
code under a number of different orchestration scenarios.
